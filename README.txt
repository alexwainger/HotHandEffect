To run our code, you'll need access to the git repo, download the sqlite database using git lfs, then run the server using the command "node server.js" from the root of the project directory. If you get a strange error that seems to be related to node, you likely need to run "npm install" and "npm install sqlite3" to get the correct modules.

To run any of our scrapers, you'll need run "python backend/python/<whichever script>" from the root directory. You'll need the SQLite databse file, which again can be obtained using GIT LFS.

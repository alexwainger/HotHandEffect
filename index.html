<p>The “hot hand” in basketball is the belief that a player who has made a few shots in a row is more likely to make subsequent shots than he would be following a few misses or a mix of makes and misses. In other words, a player who has made a few shots in a row is considered to be “hot” and thus more likely to make the shots that follow; on the other end of the spectrum, a player who has missed a few shots in a row is considered to be “cold” and thus less likely to make the shots that follow. Our project aims to investigate the legitimacy of the “hot hand” effect in basketball — do players actually shoot more effectively following a made basket, or is the “hot hand” a fallacy?</p>
